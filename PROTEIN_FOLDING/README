these files taken from GDZ n05:

/scratch/aelcock/CSPB_HI0100_BROWNIAN/UNFOLDED_RPY/

I centered the restart.file (it should be nicely unfolded)
and I changed the Go epsilon from 0.05 to 0.80

I copied the uiowa_bd.inp.RPY file from the EXAMPLE_NATIVE_PROTEIN_DIFFUSION folder
and change the Q-des entries so that it should terminate upon folding...
